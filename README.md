# 🍬 Ibuki Yagami (`yagami-renovate-bot`)

I’m **Ibuki Yagami**! Just because I’m a student doesn't mean I can’t take charge of your repository. I’m here to persistently manage your dependencies and keep your project fresh!

I won't take "no" for an answer when it comes to updates. If there is a new version out there, I’ll find it and bring it straight to you. Don’t even think about ignoring my Pull Requests!

### 🎀 What I do:
*   **Constant Vigilance:** I’m always watching ~you~ your manifest files for any signs of aging.
*   **Unstoppable Energy:** I’ll open PRs faster than I can chase Godai-san down the street.
*   **Modern Standards:** I’ll make sure your code stays in the "new generation" where it belongs.
Since I’m not just any ordinary bot, I expect to be invited properly! You can’t just leave a girl waiting outside the gates, you know? 

***

Whether you are using **GitHub** or **Codeberg**, here is how you can let me into your repository so I can start working my magic on your dependencies:

### 🐙 Adding me on GitHub
If you want me to look after your GitHub projects, it’s simple! I operate as a **GitHub App**.

1.  **Visit my App Profile:** Go to the [yagami-renovate-bot](https://github.com/apps/yagami-renovate-bot) app page.
2.  **Click "Install":** Choose whether you want me to watch over your entire account or just specific repositories.
3.  **Permissions:** I’ll need access to read your code and write Pull Requests.
4.  **Wait for the PR:** Once installed, I'll detect your repository on my next crawl and introduce myself with a configuration PR.

### 🏔️ Adding me on Codeberg
Codeberg doesn't support Apps yet! Since I'm a bot account there, you need to invite me as a collaborator.

1.  **Go to Repository Settings:** Open the repository you want me to manage.
2.  **Collaborators:** Navigate to the `Settings` > `Collaborators` tab.
3.  **Search for me:** Type in `yagami-renovate-bot` ([profile page](https://codeberg.org/yagami-renovate-bot))
4.  **Grant Access:** Add me with **Write** access. I need to be able to branch out and create Pull Requests for those updates!
5.  **Wait for the PR:** Once I'm added, I'll detect your repository on my next crawl and introduce myself with a configuration PR.

### 🕖 Crawl schedule

I crawl installed repositories **every day at 8:19 AM (UTC+0)** to check for dependency updates and open PRs when new versions are available.

### Privacy Policy

*   **Repository Access:** I have access to any repository you grant me access to (including private ones).
*   **Security & Cache:** I use the GitHub Action runner cache. While not publicly downloadable, the owner of [yagami-renovate-bot](https://github.com/yagami-renovate-bot/yagami-renovate-bot) repository technically _**can**_, but _**will not**_ access it.
*   **Transparency:** My workflow runs on a public repository: [yagami-renovate-bot/yagami-renovate-bot](https://github.com/yagami-renovate-bot/yagami-renovate-bot).
*   **Self-Hosting:** For "top secret" repositories, it is highly recommended to [self-host](https://github.com/yagami-renovate-bot/yagami-renovate-bot/blob/main/README.md) your own instance of this bot.
